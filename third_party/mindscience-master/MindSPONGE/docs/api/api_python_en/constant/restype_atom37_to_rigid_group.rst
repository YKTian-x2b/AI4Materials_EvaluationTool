restype_atom37_to_rigid_group
=============================

Sparse encoding 21 types of amino acid. Each amino acid contains the rigid group the atoms belong to. Shape is :math:`(21, 37)` .

8 groups are
    - 0 - backbone-group Main chain rigid group corresponding to torsion angle `backbone` between atoms :math:`N-C\alpha-C-C\beta` in amino acid. CA is the origin point, C is on positive x-axis and N is on X-Y plane.
    - 1 - pre-omega-group Rigid group corresponding to torsion angle `pre-omega` between atoms :math:`N_i-C\alpha_i-N_{i-1}-C\alpha_{i-1}` in amino acid.
    - 2 - phi-group Rigid group corresponding to torsion angle `phi` between atoms :math:`C_i-C\alpha_i-N_i-C_{i+1}` in amino acid.
    - 3 - psi-group Rigid group corresponding to torsion angle `psi` between atoms :math:`N_{i-1}-C_i-C\alpha_i-N_i` in amino acid.
    - 4 - chi1-group
    - 5 - chi2-group
    - 6 - chi3-group
    - 7 - chi4-group

chi1,2,3,4-group correspond to torsion angles in the amino acids in `chi_angle_atoms` . Torsion angles are determined by the coordinates of four atoms [A, B, C, D]. Atom B and C constitute the axis of rotation, in x-axis. The third atom C is the origin point. Atom B is on the negative x-axis. The first atom A is on X-Y plane. So we can determine the coordinate of the fourth atom D.
