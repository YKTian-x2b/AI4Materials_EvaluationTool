HHBLITS_AA_TO_ID
============================

Use the hhblits convention to map amino acids to corresponding numbers. Map some undefined single-letter symbols to definite values, such that B can be expressed as aspartic acid or aspartic acid. It is specified that B has the same number as D for aspartic acid (ASP), while J and O have the same number as X for unknown amino acid. U has the same number as C for cysteine (CYS). Z has the same number as E for glutamic acid (GLU), and '-' represents the missing amino acid. Except B, J, O, U, and Z, other letters are numbered in sequence, and their meanings correspond to those in `restype_1to3` .
